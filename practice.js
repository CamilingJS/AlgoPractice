//PROBLEM 1
//Create 100 objects -- 15 of these objects should be things that contain other things (fridge, drawer, shoebox, etc...)
//and contain and array that contains other objects. Store these objects in arrays named to the room these objects are found.



//PROBLEM 2
//You are given a string where each character represents a type of sock (s = stripes, w = white, b = black, d = dress, g = gym),
//Given this string, find how many pairs you can make of each type, and return this value as an object: 
/*
{
    stripes: Number,
    white: Number,
    black: Number,
    dress: Number,
    gym: Number
}
*/
//PROBLEM 3
